For that it is also necessary that the withdraw proceeds happens directly so the seller gets the eth asap to convert it back to their currency at a cex of their choice ... additionally i could also integrate an cex api where the seller could register their cexs account at this nft marketplace so that everything happens automatically and the seller gets the money they asked for automatically in their currency.
